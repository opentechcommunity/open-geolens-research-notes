## **Fetch geojson data related to amenities for boundary or selected bbox or area**

To fetch geojson data related to amenities for a boundary, selected bbox, or area, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Identify the area of interest.**  This can be done by drawing a boundary on the map, selecting a bbox, or uploading a geojson file.
2.  **Query a geospatial database for amenity data.**  The database should contain the geojson data for all amenities in the area of interest.
3.  **Filter the amenity data to only include the desired amenities.**  For example, the user may want to only include restaurants or parks.
4.  **Return the geojson data for the filtered amenities.**

## **Get general amenities interaction of selected area**

To get the general amenities interaction of a selected area, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Fetch the geojson data for all amenities in the selected area.**
2.  **Calculate the distance between each pair of amenities.**
3.  **Classify the distances into different categories, such as close, medium, and far.**
4.  **Count the number of amenities in each category.**
5.  **Return the counts of amenities in each category.**

## **Get quantified interaction of selected area**

To get the quantified interaction of a selected area, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Identify the amenity of interest.**  This could be a specific type of amenity, such as a restaurant, or a group of amenities, such as all amenities within a certain distance of each other.
2.  **Fetch the geojson data for all amenities in the selected area.**
3.  **Calculate the distance between the amenity of interest and each other amenity in the selected area.**
4.  **For each amenity, calculate the number of interacting amenities within a certain distance.**
5.  **Aggregate the number of interacting amenities for each amenity in the selected area.**
6.  **Return the aggregated number of interacting amenities for each amenity in the selected area.**

In addition to the number of interacting amenities, the intensity of the interaction can also be calculated. This can be done by dividing the number of interacting amenities by the distance to the nearest interacting amenity.

## **Get area of selected region - bbox, polygon, circle**

To get the area of a selected region, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Identify the type of region.**  This could be a bbox, polygon, or circle.
2.  **Calculate the area of the region using the appropriate formula.**
3.  **Return the area of the region.**

## **Get number of items with certain amenities in a selected area**

To get the number of items with certain amenities in a selected area, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Fetch the geojson data for all amenities in the selected area.**
2.  **Filter the amenity data to only include the desired amenities.**
3.  **Count the number of amenities in the filtered data.**
4.  **Return the count of amenities in the filtered data.**

## **Get indicators of an area**

To get the indicators of an area, the following steps can be taken:

1.  **Fetch the geojson data for all amenities in the selected area.**
2.  **Calculate the indicators of interest.**  For example, the user may want to calculate the average income or the percentage of residents with a college degree.
3.  **Return the calculated indicators.**

These are just a few examples of the calculations that can be performed on geospatial data. By incorporating these calculations into an interactive geospatial data visualization tool, users can gain a deeper understanding of the spatial distribution of amenities and other features, and how they interact with each other.
