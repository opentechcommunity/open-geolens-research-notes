# Infrastructures Affecting Life Expectancy

## General Perspective

Infrastructures play a pivotal role in influencing life expectancy through various channels. Physical infrastructures encompassing roads, bridges, railways, airports, energy systems, and water and sanitation networks facilitate easier access to critical services such as healthcare and education. Concurrently, social infrastructures like education, healthcare, and social security systems enhance overall well-being by providing essential resources and support.

## OSM Data

OpenStreetMap (OSM) represents a collaborative endeavor aimed at creating a comprehensive and openly accessible global map. It stands as an invaluable resource for identifying and analyzing infrastructure data with direct implications for life expectancy. For instance, OSM data can be effectively harnessed to pinpoint the locations of healthcare facilities, road networks, bridges, public transportation systems, green spaces, and vulnerable regions.

## Finding Infrastructure Data in OSM

Locating and analyzing OSM data is feasible through an array of tools and resources, with one prominent tool being the Overpass Turbo website. This platform empowers users to craft queries within the OSM database, generating outcomes in diverse formats such as GeoJSON, XML, and CSV.

To discover infrastructure data in OSM, users can employ the Overpass Turbo query builder to construct queries that refine the OSM database for specific object types. As an example, the ensuing query will yield a list of all healthcare facilities in the Nepal:

    [out:json];
    area["ISO3166-1"="NP"]->.boundaryarea;
    (
      node["amenity"="hospital"](area.boundaryarea);
      node["amenity"="clinic"](area.boundaryarea);
      node["amenity"="doctors"](area.boundaryarea);
      node["amenity"="dentist"](area.boundaryarea);
      node["amenity"="pharmacy"](area.boundaryarea);
    );
    out geom;

The results of such queries can be exported to files or visualized on maps.

## Analyzing OSM Data

Once OSM data is acquired, it becomes amenable to thorough analysis, permitting the identification of discernible patterns and trends. For instance, users can create spatial representations illustrating the dispersion of healthcare facilities within a given geographical area. Additionally, calculations for the average distance to the nearest healthcare facility in each neighborhood can highlight areas that lack sufficient healthcare infrastructure and necessitate further investment.

## Using OSM Data to Uncover Infrastructure Impacting Life Expectancy

The following demonstrate how OSM data can be instrumental in uncovering infrastructure that influences life expectancy:

1.  **Proximity of healthcare facilities**: OSM data enables the identification of healthcare facilities' locations, including hospitals and clinics. This information supports the creation of maps showcasing their geographical distribution and the calculation of average distances to the nearest facility, aiding in pinpointing underserved regions requiring healthcare infrastructure investment.
    
2.  **Accessibility and quality of transportation**: OSM data assists in locating roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, offering insights into their accessibility within specific geographic areas. Moreover, it enables the assessment of infrastructure quality, encompassing road and bridge conditions and the reliability of public transportation services.
    
3.  **Environmental factors**: OSM data can pinpoint environmental variables impacting life expectancy, such as air and water quality. Utilizing this data, maps depicting the distribution of these factors within a particular region can be generated, allowing for targeted interventions in areas most affected by pollution.
    
4.  **Quality of living environments and green spaces**: OSM data aids in identifying factors influencing living conditions, such as access to green spaces and pollution exposure. By creating maps illustrating these factors' distribution, policymakers can focus on investing in green spaces and pollution control measures where they are most needed.
    
5.  **Neighborhood walkability and accessibility**: OSM data enables the evaluation of neighborhood walkability and accessibility. This information can guide investments in infrastructure like sidewalks and pedestrian crossings, facilitating pedestrian and cyclist mobility.
    
6.  **Disaster-prone areas and evacuation routes**: OSM data can be harnessed to identify disaster-prone areas and evacuation routes. Utilizing this information, maps can be developed to assist individuals in disaster preparedness and evacuation planning.
    
7.  **Vulnerable areas**: OSM data is instrumental in identifying vulnerable regions, including slums and informal settlements. This knowledge can inform targeted interventions and support strategies for these communities.
    

## Conclusion

OpenStreetMap (OSM) serves as an indispensable resource for discovering and analyzing infrastructure data with significant implications for life expectancy. Through the utilization of OSM data, researchers and policymakers can pinpoint underserved areas, paving the way for infrastructure investments and interventions that enhance the health and well-being of individuals and communities.
