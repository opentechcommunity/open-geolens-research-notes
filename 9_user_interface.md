# User Interface
This research note focuses on the design of a user interface for geospatial data analysis and visualization. The interface should be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, while also providing powerful features for data analysis and visualization.

**Key features**

The following are some key features that should be considered when designing the user interface:

-   **Filters:**  The interface should provide users with the ability to filter data based on various criteria, such as location, time, and attribute values. This will allow users to focus on the data that is most relevant to their analysis.
-   **Data layers:**  The interface should allow users to overlay multiple data layers on the map. This will allow users to compare different types of data and identify patterns and relationships.
-   **Data negative and positive layers:**  The interface should allow users to plot both data and the negation of data. This can be useful for identifying areas where a particular phenomenon is absent or less common.
-   **Use of map for points, roads, area and heatmap:**  The interface should allow users to visualize data in different formats, such as points, roads, areas, and heatmaps. This will allow users to choose the best visualization format for the data they are analyzing.
-   **Use of charts and graphs:**  The interface should allow users to visualize data in charts and graphs. This can be useful for identifying trends and patterns in the data.
-   **Export and download:**  The interface should allow users to export and download data and visualizations. This will allow users to share their findings with others or to use the data in other applications.
-   **Comparison:**  The interface should allow users to compare data across different locations or time periods. This can be useful for identifying changes and trends over time.
-   **Count, lengths and area:**  The interface should provide users with the ability to calculate the count, length, and area of features. This can be useful for quantifying the data and identifying areas where a particular phenomenon is more or less common.
-   **Custom profile:**  The interface should allow users to create custom profiles with their preferred filter settings, data layers, and visualization options. This will allow users to quickly access the data and visualizations that are most relevant to them.
-   **Area well-being profile:**  The interface should provide users with the ability to filter areas based on their well-being profile. This will allow users to focus on areas that are in need of support or that are experiencing well-being disparities.

**Design considerations**

When designing the user interface, it is important to consider the following:

-   **Ease of use:**  The interface should be easy to use and navigate, even for users with no prior experience with geospatial data analysis.
-   **Flexibility:**  The interface should be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of user needs and analysis tasks.
-   **Power:**  The interface should provide users with powerful tools for data analysis and visualization.
-   **Visual appeal:**  The interface should be visually appealing and engaging.

**Conclusion**

By incorporating these features into the interface, an interactive geospatial data visualization tool can be a powerful tool for exploring and understanding geospatial data. It can be used by a wide range of users, from policymakers and researchers to students and community members, to make informed decisions about how to improve well-being and development.
