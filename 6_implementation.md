# Implementation

This research note outlines a methodology for analyzing the collision of amenities in geographical areas using hexagonal grids. By breaking down this analysis into distinct values, methods, and implementation steps, we aim to provide a comprehensive approach for understanding the distribution of amenities, assessing their quality, and identifying areas prone to amenities collision or underservice.

**Values**

1.  Counts, Lengths, and Areas of Objects with Locations: This data enables the calculation of amenity density within a specific area.
2.  Counts and Lengths: Quantitative information for coverage assessment, including road length, school numbers, and hospital counts.
3.  Counts and Areas: Quantitative data to evaluate coverage, such as park area, commercial zone extent, and residential zone size.
4.  Quality Information: Assessing amenity quality, e.g., school ratings or hospital quality.

**Method**

To conduct this analysis effectively, we propose the following method:

1.  Utilize various hexagonal sizes to recursively dissect and study the map area, employing methods like the midpoint displacement algorithm or the Quadtree algorithm.
2.  Compare the output of hexagonal dissections to the following:
    -   The selected area: Identifying areas with high or low amenity concentrations.
    -   The complete area: Identifying over- or underserved regions.
    -   District area: Recognizing variations in amenity access within districts.
    -   State area: Identifying disparities in amenity access at the state level.
    -   National area: Identifying nationwide differences in amenity access.

**Implementation**

Here is a high-level overview of implementing the proposed method:

1.  Select an appropriate hexagon size based on the analysis's scale (e.g., 100 meters for a city or 1 kilometer for a country).
2.  Dissect the map area into hexagons using methods like the midpoint displacement algorithm or the Quadtree algorithm.
3.  Calculate amenity density in each hexagon by dividing the number of amenities by the hexagon's area.
4.  Compare amenity density in each hexagon with the density in the selected area, complete area, district area, state area, and national area. Visualization methods like heatmaps or scatter plots can be used.
5.  Identify areas with either high or low amenity concentrations, which may indicate the risk of amenities collision or underservice, respectively.

**Example**

To illustrate the methodology, consider the following example:

1.  Choose a hexagon size of 100 meters.
2.  Dissect a city into hexagons.
3.  Calculate the density of restaurants in each hexagon.
4.  Compare the density of restaurants in each hexagon with the city's overall restaurant density.
5.  Identify areas with high restaurant density, which may suggest amenities collision issues like increased traffic congestion and noise pollution.

**Conclusion**

The proposed method offers a robust approach to identify areas with varying concentrations of amenities. This valuable information can inform policymaking and strategy development to mitigate the negative consequences of amenities collision and ensure equitable access to essential amenities for all residents.
